               <h3>Panda</h3>
               
               <p>A group of pandas is called an embarrassment of pandas.</p>
                
               <p>Giant pandas eat and eat and eat. Every day Pandas spend 12-14 hours eating, which is more than half of a day.</p>
               
               <p> Female pandas only ovulate once each year. During that ovulation period, they are only fertile for two or three days. That is one of the reasons why the population has dwindled.</p>
                
               <p>There are two main types of pandas â€“ the giant black-and-white panda and the Red Panda.</p>
   
               <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    
               <p>You will find the Panda at pen P32, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
