               <h3>Tiger</h3>
               
               <p>They are very good swimmers. Unlike many felids, tigers are strong swimmers. They often deliberately bathe in pond.</p>
                
               <p>Leaving aside Tigers enormous body size, just look at their front-hands/legs, if you have a pet Tiger and a brutal enemy, you might as well send them for a fist fight. Kidding, you cannot have a pet tiger, it illegal! It is said that one swipe from a Tiger’s front hand is enough to kill a person or an animal, or at least break one’s bones.</p>
               
               <p>It is not necessarily true that all Tigers are nocturnal but yes, they do prefer engaging in most of their hunting activities at night. The reason behind this is that Tigers prefer avoiding human conflict during daylight and also patrol around their territory at night.</p>
                
               <p>The saddest part is that Tiger cubs are born blind and only a few survive. Literally, the newborn cubs can't see anything, they only follow the scent of their mother. Since they are born blind and can't keep up, most of them die of hunger or cold. Some even get eaten by male Tigers to make the Tigress available for mating. That’s just insane!</p>
   
               <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    
               <p>You will find the Tiger at pen P32, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
