               <h3>Gorilla</h3>
               
               <p>Our Gorilla are the smartest but not the friendliest</p>
                
               <p>Gorillas Display Human Emotions Not only do gorillas share genetic makeup with us, but they also seem to be highly intelligent. Some of this intelligence may translate into emotion..</p>
               
               <p>The gorilla is one of our closest living cousins, with whom we share 98.3 percent of our DNA. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the only cousins closer are the chimpanzee and the bonobo, which share 99 percent of our genetic makeup. Due to the close relationship, we share many characteristics with the gorilla. Their hands are very similar to ours since they have a thumb-like finger, although they have a thumb-like finger on their feet. Due to being able to hold things, they are one of the few creatures to use tools aside from humans. They also have hairless faces and small eyes. Although they walk upright, they often use their hands in a knuckle walk to get around since they have very long arms and short legs..</p>
                
               <p>Gorillas share genetic makeup with us, but they also seem highly intelligent. Some of this intelligence may translate into emotion. Although some scientists would argue that gorillas only appear to have human emotions, others adamantly feel that these giant apes do, in fact, experience emotions such as happiness and sadness. This belief is that they have a similar reaction to human laughter. When gorillas greet each other, they show affection, even hugging one another. Dr. Charlotte Uhlenbrock shares many stories of gorillas expressing emotions, including when two gorillas hugged one another after three years apart and acted like old human friends who became reacquainted.</p>
